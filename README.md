## 🧠 Technical Overview

### 🌀 Core Game Loop
Each frame performs:
- `drawBoard()` → Renders the board  
- `logic()` → Moves snake and detects collision  
- Non-blocking input detection  
- Adjustable frame delay via `sleep_ms()`

### ⚙️ Input Handling (Cross-Platform)
- **Windows:** Uses `_kbhit()` and `_getch()` from `<conio.h>`  
- **Linux/macOS:** Uses `<termios.h>`, `<unistd.h>`, `<fcntl.h>`  

### 🧩 Data Structures

| Type | Usage |
|------|--------|
| `deque<Position>` | Snake body for O(1) add/remove |
| `vector<Position>` | Obstacle coordinates |
| `struct Position` | Represents x, y |
| `enum Direction` | Tracks movement direction (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) |

### 🧱 Collision Detection
The game checks for:
- 🧱 Wall hit  
- 🪨 Obstacle hit  
- 🐍 Self-collision  

Any hit ends the game instantly.

### 🌈 Dynamic Emoji Rendering
- Emojis for modern terminals 🎨  
- Fallback to ASCII (`#`, `*`, `O`) for older ones
